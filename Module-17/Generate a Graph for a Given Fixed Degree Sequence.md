# Ex. No: 17A - Generate a Graph for a Given Fixed Degree Sequence

### Name-Ranjith Ganesh B.
### Reg No-212223060222

## AIM:
To write a Python program to generate a graph for a given **fixed degree sequence**.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Start the program.

**Step 2**: Check if the sum of the degree sequence is even.  
> (A necessary condition for the sequence to be graphical.)

- If not even, print an error message and exit the program.

**Step 3**: Use the **Havel-Hakimi algorithm** to determine whether a simple graph can be constructed from the sequence, and to generate the graph.

**Step 4**: If the graph is successfully created, **visualize it** using a graph drawing function (e.g., `networkx.draw()`).

**Step 5**: End the program.

## PYTHON PROGRAM

```

A Python program to demonstrate the adjacency
list representation of the graph
